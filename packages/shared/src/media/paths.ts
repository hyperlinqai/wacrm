// Importing them from `upload-media.ts` dragged the whole browser data
// client into the server bundle for the sake of two constants.

 *
 *   <bucket>/account-<account_id>/<timestamp>-<basename>.<ext>
 *
 * The first path segment (`account-<uuid>`) is what the bucket's RLS
 * write policies match on, so every caller MUST go through here rather
 * than hand-rolling a path — a mismatched segment is silently rejected
 * by RLS. Both the Flows builder (`node-config-form`) and the inbox
 * composer call this so the logic lives in exactly one place.
